Philosophers often debate what makes one better or worse off, but seldom debate what makes an entity the kind of thing that can be better or worse off in the first place. The first question concerns welfare goods; the second question concerns welfare subjects. This paper argues for a phenomenal theory of welfare subjecthood, according to which consciousness is what makes an entity a welfare subject. I explain what it means for an entity to be a welfare subject, present and motivate the phenomenal theory, and then defend the theory from objections. In slogan form, my view is that consciousness makes things matter.
