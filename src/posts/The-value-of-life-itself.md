Some philosophers think that life is worth living not merely because of the goods and the bads within it, but also because life itself is good. I argue instead that life itself is neither good nor bad. I explain how the view that life is worth living
for its own sake yields a dilemma: either (1) any finitely-long excellent life is worse than some longer life wholly devoid of pleasure, desire-satisfaction, knowledge, or any other goods, or (2) very brief lives involving nothing but horrific pain
are worth living. Since neither result is acceptable, we ought to reject the view that life itself is good. This result has implications for questions about the threshold for a life worth living, the value of consciousness and existence, the basic
welfare goods, the grounds of moral status, and a variety of ethical issues concerning life and death.
