There are some things that we think areintrinsically valuable, or valuablefor  their  own  sake.  Is  consciousness—subjective,  qualitative  experience—one  ofthose  things?  Some  theorists  favor  thepositive view,  according  to  which  con-sciousness is intrinsically valuable. According to a positive theorist, consciousnessitself  accrues  intrinsic  value,  independent  of  the  particular  kind  of  experienceinstantiated. In contrast, I favor theneutral view, according to which consciousnessis neither intrinsically valuable nor disvaluable. The primary purpose of this paper isto  clarify  what  is  at  stake  when  we  ask  whether  consciousness  is  intrinsicallyvaluable, to carve out the theoretical space, and to evaluate the question rigorously.The secondary purpose is to show why the neutral view is attractive and why certainarguments for the positive view do not work.
