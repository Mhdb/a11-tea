I discuss the prospects for first-person technology, or technology for enhancing first-person investigation of experience. I consider various candidates for first-person technology, ranging from existing technology (such as virtual reality devices, psychoactive drugs, and brain-machine interfaces) that can already be applied to first-person investigation to speculative technology that could be developed in the future. I develop a framework for categorizing and evaluating different kinds of first-person technology. And I examine the philosophical challenges that arise in designing and employing such technology.
