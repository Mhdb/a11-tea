We develop an account of the nature and structure of analog representation. Our core idea is that analogicity is a matter of structure representing structure. We explain how this idea can be developed into a systematic theory of analog representation that identifies three distinct measures of analogicity. We begin by developing a framework for characterizing the structures of representational systems. Then we use that framework to develop our structural theory of analog representation. After developing our view, we explain how it explains the attractive features of extant accounts while providing natural solutions to new kinds of challenge cases.
