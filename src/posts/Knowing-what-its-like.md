I argue that knowledge of what it is like to have an experience varies along a spectrum from the more exact to the more approximate. I motivate this degreed picture by appeal to limits in epistemic abilities such as recognition, imagination, and inference. I systematize the degreed picture by developing a framework for modeling how phenomenal concepts yield knowledge of phenomenal character. And I explain the implications of the degreed picture for issues about reference, knowledge, and concept possession. A noteworthy consequence is that we can acquire phenomenal concepts even for the exotic experiences of bats, octopuses, and aliens.
