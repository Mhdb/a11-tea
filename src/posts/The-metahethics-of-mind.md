I develop and defend value experientialism, the thesis that value facts about experiences (such as the fact that pain is bad) are wholly explained by phenomenal facts (such as the fact that pain hurts). I argue that value experientialism aligns with common sense, that denying it leads to counterintuitive consequences, that it explains doxastic asymmetries between different classes of ethical beliefs, and that it accounts for the epistemic defects of hedonic inverts. I also argue that we ought to embrace the surprising result that there are genuine counterexamples to the explanatory gap between descriptive facts and ethical facts.
