I argue for the possibility of an objective phenomenology—a way of understanding the phenomenal character of experiences that does not require one to have had the kinds of experiences under consideration. My central thesis is that facts that are purely about how experiences are structured are objective. I begin by developing a framework that enables us to assess the idea of objective phenomenology with greater precision. Then I diagnose what makes any given phenomenal fact subjective, argue that there is a class of objective phenomenal facts, and argue that there is a structural explanatory gap between physical facts and structural facts about experience
