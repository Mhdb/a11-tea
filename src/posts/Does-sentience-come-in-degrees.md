Mikhalevich  &  Powell  (2020) (M&P)  provideawide-rangingand  commendablediscussionof some empirical and philosophicalquestions aboutinvertebrate minds.My commentary aims to address a question that M&P mention mostlyin passing, but whichseems to me worth thinkingabout more carefully: does sentiencecome in degrees?Thisquestion isparticularly interesting in the present context:ifarthropodsare sentient, we might wonder whether some arthropods(such as ants) are in some sense less sentientthan other organisms (such as humans).
