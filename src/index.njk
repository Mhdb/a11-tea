            <p class="pt-4">I am currently a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at Rice University in association with a research seminar on Consciousness and Value directed by Uriah Kriegel and Charles Siewert. In 2020-21, I will be a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Australian National University in association with a project on the Language of Consciousness directed by Daniel Stoljar. </p>
            <p class="pt-4">Before that, I was a PhD student at NYU. At NYU, I worked with David Chalmers (PhD supervisor), Ned Block, and Thomas Nagel. I also spent two semesters as a visiting student at Institut Jean Nicod in Paris, where I worked with Uriah Kriegel.</p>
            <p class="pt-4">Before that, I was an undergrad at Brown University, where I worked with Jaegwon Kim and Christopher Hill. I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Philosophy, BS in Cognitive Science, and an MA in Philosophy. I was a recipient of the Beinecke Scholarship in 2012.</p>
            <p class="pt-4">Before that, I was an International Baccalaureate student at Shawnee Mission East High School, which is when I first discovered my interest in philosophy. I wrote my senior paper on philosophical zombies.</p>
            <p class="pt-4">Outside my academic interests, I also like fitness, food, and games. Sometimes when I’m not thinking about experiences, I even have some experiences of my own.</p>

                  1. The formal structure of conscious experiences
                </summary>

                <span class="text-white">
                  Conscious experiences are structured. Consider how your perceptual experience breaks down into sensory modalities, how your pain experiences come in different degrees of intensity, and how your color experiences have hue, saturation, and brightness
                  as dimensions of variation. However, while it is obvious that experiences have structure, there has been little consensus on basic questions about that structure. My work aims to identify what kinds of structures conscious experiences have and
                  develops formal models that capture that structure.

                  2. The ethics and metaethics of consciousness
                </summary>

                <span class="text-white pt-2">
                  There is a common intuition that there are intimate connections between consciousness and value. If you lost the capacity for consciousness but remained otherwise the same, you would lose much of what makes your life good. My work argues that
                  consciousness itself has no intrinsic value but argues that consciousness and value are nevertheless systematically connected. Amongst other things, I argue that some ethical facts are derivable from purely descriptive phenomenal facts, that pain is
                  bad purely because of how it feels, and that consciousness is what makes an entity a welfare subject.

                  3. The epistemology of conscious experiences
                </summary>

                <span class="text-white pt-2">
                  Our knowledge of our own conscious experiences differs from our knowledge of the external world. But what exactly does that difference consist in? My work aims to answer this by examining questions about the nature and structure of introspection,
                  imagination, phenomenal concepts, and phenomenal knowledge. A theme is that the epistemology of experience is special, but not always in the ways that philosophers have traditionally thought.
